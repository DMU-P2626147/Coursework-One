    <p>When George MacKay walked into casting director Nina Gold's office to record his audition for First World War epic 1917, he knew very little about the project. The screenplay was not being released and he was given only a couple of pages for the scenes he would be performing as lance corporal Schofield. Even so, recalls the actor, "I remember thinking, 'I know this man.' Or at least I know an interpretation that I would like to give".

    It was only when MacKay met director Sam Mendes for the next stage of the audition process that he learned the special nature of the project: that the film would be presented to the audience in one continuous shot; that individual scenes would run up to eight or nine minutes; and that extensive rehearsals would be needed to refine these ambitious shots, taking his total time commitment on 1917 to seven months. MacKay's reaction: "So exciting - just because it gets so ambitious. Itâ€™s a new way of working. Sam explained how rehearsal-heavy it would be and it would be like a play, in a way."

    During the extended rehearsal process, Mendes worked intensively with the two young men and department heads to precisely align the words in the screenplay with the movement of the actors and the dimensions of the sets and locations. As MacKay explains: "Usually you craft a film's rhythm in the edit." But that luxury would not be available to 1917 - "and because these guys are always on the move", he continues, "the length of the scene and the rhythm of the scene dictate the length of the set. The corner needs to come on the line that it needs to come, and the line needs to come where the corner is. There is no lead element and they have to be worked out together from scratch".</p></div>

    <p>"Oh, I could go on and on and on. You know what, I could never have done this film without George. Dead serious. We spent six months rehearsing together and just sort of even watching George act, I've learned a lot. To be in a scene with him, for nine, ten minutes at a time of being lost with him, has honestly been one of the highlights of my career.

    We've been asked a lot "what was the most difficult scene to film?" and you can't just say one! All of it was so difficult in its own way. Each shot had its own challenge and difficulty but I loved the No Man's Land sequence with Blake and Schofield. The whole flow of it is just amazing, what they did with the cameras behind the scenes with the rigs is just amazing.

    Sam (Director) is very skillful and a real master of what he does. All of this was masterminded by Sam - it's his idea, his vision - and he's a superb director."</p></div>
